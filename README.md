 Efficiently Finding the Smallest Missing Positive Integer in an Unsorted Array
Imagine you are developing a powerful data analysis tool, and you're tasked with creating a Java program that can efficiently find the smallest positive integer missing from an unsorted integer array. This tool is crucial for processing large datasets, and its success relies on your ability to implement an optimized solution. The program should be able to handle arrays of varying sizes and provide accurate results.
To achieve this, your Java program needs to utilize a two-step approach. First, it should transform the array to ensure positive integers are in their correct positions. Then, it should identify the smallest missing positive integer. The program should take user input to specify the number of rows and columns in the array, as well as the array elements.
To use this program, the user should provide the following input:
The number of rows and columns in the array.
The array elements.

Examples:
Input: 3 3
	   3 1 -1
	   5 8 -2
	   7 2 0
Output: Smallest Missing Positive Integer: 4

Input: 2 4
       6 2 1 4 
	   -3 5 7 8
Output: Smallest Missing Positive Integer: 3
